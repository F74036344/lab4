<Q1>
The result I get(only list the part that the question 1 demands):
$ nm lab4_Q1
0000000000600e50 d _DYNAMIC
......
00000000004004b4 T _Z7averagePdRd
00000000004004e2 T _Z7averageif
......
000000000040050a T main

So the identifier for the first function is PdRd(Pointerdouble,Referencedouble)
and the one for the second is if(integer,float)


<Q2>
The output of the program:
<result acquired from my computer.(OS:Windows)>
1 4
4 4
4 4
8 4
<result acquired from the server pd2.imslab.org.(OS:Linux)>
1 8
4 8
4 8
8 8

Based on the result above:
1.No matter the type of the variable is , the size of the pointer
points to the variable is  unchanged.
2.The size of the pointer may differ because of the OS.
